* Linear Technology LTC6802/LTC6803 Multicell Battery Stack Monitor

Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "lltc,ltc6802" or "lltc,ltc6803"
  - reg: Chip select number for the device
  - spi-cpol: Device requires inverse clock polarity mode
  - spi-cpha: Device requires shifted clock phase mode
  - spi-max-frequency: Maximum clocking speed of device in Hz
  - device-address: Address of serial interface set with pins A3..A1

Example:
adc@0 {
	compatible = "lltc,ltc6802";
	reg = <0>;
	spi-cpol;
	spi-cpha;
	spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
	device-address = <3>;
};
